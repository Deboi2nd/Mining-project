# Mining Project

This is a simple incremental game made by Deboi and [Skell](https://github.com/FriendSkullaton).

## How to Play

1. Click main button to mine gold
2. Once you have 50 gold, you can buy a pickaxe to mine faster.
3. Once you have 100 gold, you can buy a miner to manually mine gold for you.
4. To buy, the store is in the side nav.

## Future Installments

If we ever plan to pick this back up, we plan on making more store bought items and different areas in the mines to explore.

**Have Fun!**
